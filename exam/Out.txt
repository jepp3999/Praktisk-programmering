I have made a random symmetric matrix A, which looks like:

         4          8          3          8          0          2 
         8          7          9          8          1          3 
         3          9          2          6          8          5 
         8          8          6          6          1          4 
         0          1          8          1          6          6 
         2          3          5          4          6          6 
I apply the routine, where I have made use of Lagrange multiplier and an analytical Jacobian.
The use of the Lagrange multiplier is due to the constraint that the eigenvector of the matrix should have unit length.
I then use a slightly modified root search routine to find the following eigenvector and eigenvalue
eigenvalue = -2.86374743355176
eigenvector =    -0.713    -0.0824      0.207      0.639      -0.19    -0.0873 
We need to check that the these eigenvectors solve the system.
A*v-lambda*v=   0.00177   0.000254  -0.000517   -0.00165   0.000438   0.000264 
which should be zero.
We also need to check that the constraint actually worked, i.e. that the eigenvectors have unit length. So we take the dot-product
v^T v = 1.00925811147656
We see that the dot product is approximately equal to 1. So the constraint is forfilled
